          "It's about what speaks to you": Displaying paintings, prints,
          textiles and sculptures can all help create a fresh living space for
          the new year – here's how, according to the experts.

          <b>January</b> is a popular time of year to refresh priorities – and
          perhaps our surroundings too, creating a new mood for a new year. New
          artworks can transform a living space, and also inspire future
          interests, intentions, or the desire for fresh goals. Even
          repositioning our existing paintings, prints and photographs can
          revitalise a home and feel like a new start.

          Imaginatively chosen and displayed art can both revive cherished
          memories and prompt feelings of wellbeing – and it can change the
          whole ambience of a space. Abstract art, for instance, evokes moods in
          a non-literal, suggestive way – a large painting or print dominated by
          loose, expressionistic mark-making can give a home a romantic,
          free-spirited feel, while a more hard-edged, graphic style gives a
          space a modern, urban feel. Acquiring and displaying art isn't the
          preserve of homeowners, either; in fact, it's a great way to make a
          rental home feel more personal, without having to redecorate – and
          your pictures can move on when you do. It's this flexibility that
          makes art such a useful element of home décor – artworks can be
          arranged, then reconfigured to change the character of a room. "A
          piece doesn't have to be in one location forever," says Katherine
          Kittoe, founder of Kittoe Contemporary, an online and physical art
          gallery and art consultancy that promotes emerging and established
          artists. "A re-hang of artworks every few years – similar in principle
          to re-hangs in large public galleries, though obviously on a more
          modest scale – can be hugely rewarding and refreshing."

          This, though, raises the practical but important question of how to
          repair walls dented by holes left after hanging. "Small nails are your
          best friend – they're easy to patch up with spackling paste when it’s
          time to move out," says Cathy Glazer, founder of Artfully Walls, a
          curated site for art-buyers in the UK and US. "Lightweight pieces can
          be hung with thin nails and hooks from a basic picture-hanging kit.
          Most standard picture-hangers hold up to 30lbs. It's easier still to
          lean art on ledges or on stacks of books, mantelpieces or consoles for
          a very casual look." Of course, when art is added to a home, it must
          coexist with furniture and homeware accumulated over time. Yet it
          needn't vie for attention with existing elements or get visually lost
          among them – it can be artfully displayed adjacent to homeware with
          similar qualities, for example echoing the bold, colourful pattern in
          a rug or the sensual curves of ceramics. And it can be shown with
          ephemera – from postcards to family snaps – to create aesthetically
          pleasing juxtapositions.

          Wall-hung art can counterbalance the bulky, imposing look of furniture
          that occupies a permanent spot, such as sofas, according to Sophie
          Goldhill, co-founder of Liddicoat & Goldhill and its interior design
          arm, Hector Interiors: "A striking painting can serve as a visual
          focal point paired with sofas and tables, and can offset the weight of
          larger pieces that could otherwise dominate a space," she tells the
          BBC.And introducing a new artwork into a room can make the space more
          cohesive, Goldhill adds. "Art offers an opportunity to link different
          design elements, such as contrasting materials or colours, in a space,
          ensuring it doesn't feel disjointed. A thoughtfully chosen piece of
          art can reflect or complement tones in fabrics or wood, tying the
          room's design together."

          Opting for usable art can make buying and displaying artworks fun and
          accessible. A set of coasters and placemats – created with images by
          UK photographer Martin Parr and sold by art platform Plinth – is a
          good example. The aptly food-themed creations feature kitsch, close-up
          photos of cocktails filled with maraschino cherries, ice cream or tea
          in traditional cups and saucers.
